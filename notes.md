Spread sheet cells have rows and numbers

* How to Create a Formula:

1) Click to select a cell, then enter "=" to start a formula
2) Next, enter the formula. For example "=C4*D4"
3) Press enter to execute the formula

* How to copy a formula
  1) Use "copy" and "paste" to copy a formula to a single cell
  2) Fill down values using a formula by clicking the green square in a cell and dragging down the selected cell

* =Max(range)
Finds maximum value in a range

* =Avg(range)
Calculates average from a range of values
"Decrease decimals" = "Minder decimalen"

* =Min(range)
Finds minimum value in range

* Use logical test
  click a cell, type "=if(D4>40,D4-40,0)"
  This means: if the value of D4 is bigger than 40, calculate overtime as the value of D4 minus 40, else value is zero.

  NL: =ALS(D4>40;D4-40;0)

* Relative vs. absolute referencing
  
  ="C4*D4" vs "$C4*D4"
  "$C4" tells Excel to always reference column C 

  In Excel, relative references change as you copy a formula, while absolute references remain constant regardless of where you copy the formula, denoted by a dollar sign ($) before the column and/or row.
